# Problem 1

This is a dataframe which contains four variables.

```{r}
example_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("v","i","c","t","o","r","i","a","t","h"),
  vec_factor =c("low","medium","low","high","high","medium","low","high","medium","medium")
)
```

Then take the mean of each variable and see what will happen.

```{r}
x = mean(pull(example_df,norm_samp))
x

y = mean(pull(example_df,vec_logical))
y

z = mean(pull(example_df,vec_char))
z

w = mean(pull(example_df,vec_factor))
w
```
